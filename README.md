# Superfighters Modded

My personal modded version of Superfighters. Made for fun.

## How to play

Download `superfighters_modded.swf` and `Superfighters.exe`, put them in the same folder and run the exe.

## What's changed

**Movement:**
- Sprint is faster (1.5x)
- Dive goes further and does more damage
- Infinite stamina

**Guns:**
- All bullets do double damage
- Sniper kills in one shot
- Magnum shoots all 6 bullets at once
- UZI fires way faster
- Shotgun has more pellets and wider spread
- Flamethrower has more ammo and shoots more fire

**Melee:**
- Sword, axe, machete all kill in 1-2 hits

**Other stuff:**
- Molotovs explode bigger (like grenades)
- Barrels have bigger explosions
- You spawn with a random gun and random throwables
- Hard AI dodges bullets better

## Source code

The `export_scripts` folder has all the decompiled ActionScript. Use FFDec to edit and recompile.
